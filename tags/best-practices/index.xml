&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (AWS)&lt;/a> recommends that organizations prepare to recover workloads in the event of cybersecurity incidents or business continuity events such as natural disasters or technical failures. In this post, we provide guidance and strategies for Public Sector organizations to use AWS infrastructure to operate resilient systems in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS recommends that its customers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use cybersecurity frameworks and AWS architectural best practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implement a multi-account environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/">infrastructure as code (IaC)&lt;/a> to deploy AWS environments and workloads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare a recovery account in an Availability Zone or &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region">Region&lt;/a> different from the primary workload.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include all application code, IaC code, configuration files, and other dependencies in the recovery account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define a data backup strategy to the recovery account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implement automated testing (unit and full workload) in the recovery account.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="use-an-established-framework">Use an established framework&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As cybersecurity incidents like ransomware increase, Public Sector organizations look to frameworks such as the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0&lt;/a> from the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)&lt;/a> to guide better cybersecurity risk governance. While the CSF organizes cybersecurity outcomes by functions (govern, identify, protect, detect, respond, recover), NIST does not prescribe specific ways to achieve those outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Characteristics of Financial Services HPC Workloads on the Cloud</title><link>https://phatpham14.github.io/fcj-fa25/3-blogstranslated/3.1-blog1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phatpham14.github.io/fcj-fa25/3-blogstranslated/3.1-blog1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>By Mark Norton and Flamur Gogolli&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post introduces the High Performance Computing (HPC) requirements in the Financial Services Industry (FSI). It defines the technical attributes of compute-heavy workloads and discusses their essential characteristics. Additionally, it provides a decision tree process to help customers select the right HPC platform on the cloud—whether from commercial vendors, open-source, or cloud-native solutions—based on customer and workload requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it cannot cover every possible option, this article provides guidance on how to achieve price-performance goals and solve HPC challenges using AWS services and solutions, based on experience with Financial Services customers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Frugal HPC Architect – Ensuring Effective FinOps for HPC Workloads at Scale</title><link>https://phatpham14.github.io/fcj-fa25/3-blogstranslated/3.4-blog4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phatpham14.github.io/fcj-fa25/3-blogstranslated/3.4-blog4/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>By Alex Kimber&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Adopting flexible, on-demand, and scalable computing in the cloud brings many benefits. It frees organizations from long, repetitive procurement processes associated with on-premises infrastructure, which often require educated guesses for sizing, resulting in infrastructure that is only as good as the day it was installed. While the focus of this article is on cost reduction, it is also important to recognize the opportunities that testing at scale can unlock. The cloud allows customers to achieve levels of scale that would be financially impossible with on-premises infrastructure because it can be provisioned for the duration of any individual workload and then released. However, with flexible provisioning in the cloud comes cost variability that can concern organizations with fixed budgets or tight profit margins.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
