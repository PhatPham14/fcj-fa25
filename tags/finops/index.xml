&lt;p>Adopting flexible, on-demand, and scalable computing in the cloud brings many benefits. It frees organizations from long, repetitive procurement processes associated with on-premises infrastructure, which often require educated guesses for sizing, resulting in infrastructure that is only as good as the day it was installed. While the focus of this article is on cost reduction, it is also important to recognize the opportunities that testing at scale can unlock. The cloud allows customers to achieve levels of scale that would be financially impossible with on-premises infrastructure because it can be provisioned for the duration of any individual workload and then released. However, with flexible provisioning in the cloud comes cost variability that can concern organizations with fixed budgets or tight profit margins.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
