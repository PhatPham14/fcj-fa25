During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) - First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **September 10, 2025** to **November 27, 2025**, I had the valuable opportunity to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience on the AWS platform.

I directly participated in **deeply researching AWS services and building a Group Project with a hybrid architecture combining Serverless and Managed Services**, thereby significantly improving skills in: **System Architecture Design (Solution Architecture), DevOps implementation (CI/CD), Backend programming, Technical writing, and Teamwork**.

Regarding professional conduct, I maintained a high level of proactivity in my work and collaborated well with fellow FCJers. However, I am also clearly aware of my limitations regarding discipline and communication, allowing me to plan for future improvement.

To objectively reflect on the internship process, I would like to self-assess based on the criteria below:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | **Professional Knowledge & Skills** | Understanding of AWS, application in real projects, tool proficiency (Git, CLI, IDE), code quality, and architecture | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Learning Ability** | Ability to acquire new technologies (Docker, Serverless, NoSQL) and best practices quickly | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactivity** | Self-researching documentation, accepting difficult tasks, and proposing solutions without waiting for detailed instructions | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of Responsibility** | Commitment to completing work on time (Deadlines), ensuring project output quality | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adherence to timekeeping, regulations, workflows, and periodic reporting | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Growth Mindset** | Willingness to receive feedback from Mentors/colleagues and making changes to improve oneself | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting technical ideas, reporting progress, and discussing within the group | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Team Collaboration** | Coordinating smoothly with members, supporting each other when encountering bugs, avoiding blame | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional Conduct** | Respecting colleagues, Mentors, and the general culture of the FCJ organization | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem Solving Mindset** | Identifying the root cause of errors, proposing optimal and creative solutions | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to Project/Org** | Actual work efficiency, contribution to the success of the Final Showcase | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | General assessment of the entire internship process and results achieved | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

### Personal Improvement Plan (Next Steps)

Based on the assessment above, I recognize my strengths in **technical expertise and proactivity**, but I need to seriously address the following weaknesses to become a more professional engineer:

* **Enhance Discipline:** I realize I need to be stricter with myself regarding adherence to company regulations.
* **Improve Problem-Solving Mindset:** Although I can resolve tasks, I want to cultivate a multidimensional perspective. Instead of just finding a solution to "make the code run," I will focus on deeply analyzing the performance, cost, and security of that solution.
* **Learn Effective Communication:** I will focus on improving my presentation skills, specifically articulating complex technical issues concisely and clearly. Simultaneously, I will practice calmness and tact when handling conflicting situations or defending personal viewpoints.
