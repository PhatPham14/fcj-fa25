# Summary Report: “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop”

### Event Information

- **Time:** 08:30 – 12:00, Saturday, November 15, 2025.
- **Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, HCMC.
- **Topic:** Exploring the AI/ML landscape and practicing building Generative AI applications on AWS.

### Objectives

- **Market Insight:** Understand the context and development trends of AI/ML in Vietnam.
- **Mastering Tools:** Access the Amazon SageMaker platform for comprehensive Machine Learning processes (End-to-end ML).
- **Approaching GenAI:** Learn how to use Amazon Bedrock to build advanced Generative AI applications.

### Key Content & Agenda

The workshop was divided into two in-depth technical sessions with practical Demos:

#### 1. Overview & Amazon SageMaker (09:00 – 10:30)
- **AI/ML Landscape:** Overview of the market and common use cases in Vietnam.
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Exploring the comprehensive ML lifecycle management platform:
    - Data preparation & labeling.
    - Model Training, Tuning, and Deployment.
    - Integrated MLOps to automate processes.
- **Live Demo:** Walkthrough of the **SageMaker Studio** interface, visualizing how a model is built and deployed to production.

#### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (10:45 – 12:00)
- **Foundation Models (FMs):** Comparison and guidance on selecting foundation models like Claude, Llama, and Titan suitable for specific problems.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques to optimize prompts: Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Few-shot learning.
- **RAG & Agents:**
    - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture combined with Knowledge Base to increase accuracy.
    - **Bedrock Agents:** Building multi-step workflows and integrating external tools.
- **Guardrails:** Setting up content safety filters.
- **Live Demo:** Building a complete **Generative AI Chatbot** using Amazon Bedrock right in the session.

### Key Highlights & Takeaways

#### SageMaker standardizes the ML process
- Previously, I thought ML workflows were very fragmented, but through the SageMaker demo, I saw the seamlessness from raw data processing to having an API endpoint. The built-in MLOps capabilities help minimize a lot of manual operational effort.

#### The Power of Generative AI & RAG
- The most impressive part was the **RAG** technique. Combining proprietary data (Knowledge Base) with the power of LLMs (like Claude) solves the AI "hallucination" problem. This is key to applying AI to enterprise problems requiring high accuracy.

#### Prompt Engineering is a new skill
- I learned that how you ask (Prompting) determines 50% of the quality of the AI's answer. Techniques like "Chain-of-Thought" truly help the model think more logically.

### Personal Reflection

The **AI/ML/GenAI on AWS** workshop came at the perfect time as I was looking for solutions to integrate intelligent features into my Group Project.

Seeing a GenAI Chatbot built in under 30 minutes thanks to **Amazon Bedrock** was truly impressive. It shifted my mindset from "building models from scratch" (very costly) to "leveraging existing models" (via API).

> **Conclusion:** An extremely productive Saturday morning! I have added a powerful tool (Amazon Bedrock) to my toolkit.
