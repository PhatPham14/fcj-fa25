# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Day Vietnam 2025 – HCMC Connect Edition”

### Event Information

- **Time:** September 18, 2025 (Running parallel with the main session in Hanoi).
- **Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Floors 26 & 36, Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, HCMC.
- **Scale:** A satellite event dedicated to the "Builders" community in HCMC.

### Objectives

- **Update Trends:** Learn about the latest technologies regarding **Generative AI** and **Modernization** that AWS is promoting in the Vietnam market.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Participate in technical workshop sessions to practice practical skills instead of just listening to theory.
- **Networking:** Connect with AWS experts (Solution Architects), developers, and the tech community in the Southern region.

### Key Content & Agenda

The event was divided into two main parts: A livestream of the plenary session from Hanoi and on-site Breakout Tracks.

#### 1. Plenary Session (Livestream)
- Watched the opening session and key announcements regarding AWS's Cloud & AI strategy in Vietnam.
- Keynote Speakers shared their vision of Cloud infrastructure and the impact of AI on businesses.

#### 2. Breakout Tracks & Workshops
The event in HCMC focused on 2 technical tracks that I was very interested in:

* **Track 1: Gen AI & Data**
    * Focused on how to build applications integrating Generative AI using **Amazon Bedrock** and **Amazon Q Developer**.
    * How to build a solid Data Foundation to serve AI.

* **Track 2: Migration & Modernization**
    * Strategies for cloud migration and application modernization.
    * Transitioning from Monolithic architecture to Microservices and Serverless (very relevant to the Group Project I am working on).

* **Speakers & Experts:** The event featured reputable experts such as Mr. Nguyen Gia Hung, Mr. Eric Yeo, Mr. Toan Do, along with the Solution Architects team from AWS Vietnam.

### Key Highlights & Takeaways

#### GenAI is no longer just theory
- Through live demos, I saw that integrating GenAI into applications has become easier thanks to Managed Services like Amazon Bedrock. This opens up new directions for optimizing user experiences in future projects.

#### Modernization is a mandatory journey
- In Track 2, speakers emphasized that "Modernization" is not just about changing technology (from EC2 to Lambda/Fargate) but also changing operational mindsets. Using **Managed Services** (like RDS, ElastiCache) helps reduce the administrative burden to focus on business logic.

#### Hands-on Workshop Experience
- Unlike just sitting and listening, the HCMC Connect Edition allowed me to directly manipulate the AWS environment (Hands-on labs). Being guided by experts to fix errors directly on the spot helped me understand deeply how to configure security and optimize costs.

### Personal Reflection

Attending **AWS Cloud Day - HCMC Connect Edition** was a very different experience compared to standard seminars.

I felt the closeness and high practicality. Instead of just listening to macro-level speeches, I got to sit with other "Builders", discussing code, architecture, and specific technical issues.

The event helped reinforce my belief in the **Cloud Engineer** path I am pursuing. Especially, early access to GenAI knowledge gave me more ideas to propose improvements for the team's upcoming graduation project (Final Showcase).

> **Conclusion:** An effective knowledge "recharge" day right at the "headquarters" of AWS Vietnam! ☁️🚀
