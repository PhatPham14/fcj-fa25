> Here are my personal thoughts on my journey participating in the First Cloud Journey program. These opinions aim to help the FCJ team improve even further in future seasons.

### General Assessment

**1. Working Environment**
The environment at FCJ is extremely dynamic. I am very impressed by everyone's openness; the working atmosphere is both professional and very comfortable, helping me reduce pressure when first approaching the vast amount of AWS knowledge. The workspace (both offline and online) created the best conditions for me to focus on the project.

**2. Mentor / Team Admin Support**
The Mentors are extremely dedicated. I really like how they guide us: not "spoon-feeding" answers but prompting issues so I can research AWS documentation myself and find the Solution. This helped me train my proactive thinking a lot. The Team Admin also enthusiastically supported processes, documentation, and credits so I wasn't interrupted during lab practice.

**3. Alignment between Work and Major**
The internship work here is a perfect stepping stone for my major. At school, I learned about computer networks and basic programming, but at FCJ, I applied them in reality with Cloud Computing. Building a Hybrid Architecture combined with Serverless is a valuable practical experience that school hasn't fully provided.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
This is the criterion I rate highest. In 12 weeks, I not only learned AWS services (ECS, Lambda, DynamoDB...) but also professional software development processes (CI/CD, DevOps). Besides hard skills, I also learned how to write concise technical documentation and presentation skills to defend my solution.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
FCJ's "Build - Learn - Share" culture truly spreads. During the Group Project, despite heated debates about architecture or encountering difficult bugs right before demo day, the whole group still "carried the team" together and supported each other fully. I felt I truly belonged to this collective, not just an intern passing through.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**
Being granted an AWS Sandbox account to practice freely without worrying about personal costs is a huge benefit for students like me. Additionally, internal workshops and career orientation sharing from seniors were very practical.

### Other Questions

**1. What were you most satisfied with during the internship?**
It is the sense of "ownership". I was trusted to build important modules in a real project, allowed to make mistakes and fix them. Seeing the system I built run smoothly during the Final Showcase was what satisfied me most.

**2. What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**
Honestly, looking back at the whole journey accompanying my peers as well as the seniors, I cannot find any points that need improvement because everything is currently too okay. From detailed instruction documents to clear regulations, everything has helped me a lot. Besides that, there is only a tiny, insignificant point about the group chat (specifically in the "Proposals & Wishes" section).

**3. Would you recommend this internship to your friends? Why?**
Definitely yes. I will advise friends passionate about Cloud to join. Because this is not a "fetching coffee" internship, but a place for real "combat". The pressure might be high, but the knowledge and maturity gained are completely worth it.

### Proposals & Wishes

**1. Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
I suggest having additional WhatsApp groups. One group dedicated to important announcements from mentors or team admins, and another group specifically for sharing experiences, answering questions, etc. This will avoid the case of messages getting buried and us missing updates from the seniors.

**2. Do you want to continue this program in the future?**
I very much look forward to the opportunity to continue participating in the program.
