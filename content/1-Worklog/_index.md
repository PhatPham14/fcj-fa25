**On this page**, I present an overview of my worklog.

**How I completed it:** I successfully completed this worklog through the **First Cloud Journey** internship program. My methodology involved a combination of self-study on AWS Skill Builder and Coursera, alongside the practical implementation of a real-world Group Project.

**Duration:** The program spanned **12 weeks** (approximately 3 months).

**What I did:** During these weeks, I progressed from fundamental Cloud concepts and research skills to designing architectures, coding, implementing DevOps pipelines, and securing a complete application on AWS.
